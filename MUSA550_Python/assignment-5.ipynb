    "In this assignment, we'll explore restaurant review data available through the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). The dataset includes Yelp data for user reviews and business information for many metropolitan areas. I've already downloaded this dataset (8 GB total!) and extracted out the data files for reviews and restaurants in Philadelphia. I've placed these data files into the `data` directory in this repository. \n",

    "This assignment is broken into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1:** Analyzing correlations between restaurant reviews and census data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore the relationship between restaurant reviews and the income levels of the restaurant's surrounding area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2:** Exploring the impact of fast food restaurants\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll run a sentiment analysis on reviews of fast food restaurants and estimate income levels in neighborhoods with fast food restaurants. We'll test how well our sentiment analysis works by comparing the number of stars to the sentiment of reviews.\n",
